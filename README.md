This is my random little thing I made just for practice

It is quite a simple little website tool made with next.js
I used it to practice reading from apis and displaying data out on the page depending on what filter I have. I used the list of countries api I found on the web
then had a filter by capital and if I wanted I could try make it filter by other things but I just wanted to do this for now but maybe in the future I will update
this with multiple filters and other features.
